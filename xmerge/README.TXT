IMPORTANT!

In order to make this project buildable as well as maintainable, I have moved 
the java source which made up the individual jar files from this projects into 
individual sub-folders in xmerge/source. The old sources are kept in the 
xmerge/java tree for reference only. Any changes/fixes should be made on the 
new source-trees.
