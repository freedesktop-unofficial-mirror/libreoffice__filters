<!-- converter.dtd

     Author: Brian Cameron

     This DTD file is provided for documentation and development
     purposes, the converter does not actually validate the
     converter.xml files that it processes.  Plug-ins will not
     work properly, though, if the converter.xml does not
     conform to this DTD specification.  -->

<!-- The root node, converters, must contain one or more
     converter nodes, each corresponds to a converter plug-in. -->

<!ELEMENT converters (converter)+>

<!-- The converter node must contain two elements:
     type    - The convert-from mime-type.
     version - The version of the plug-in.

     Each converter node must contain these child nodes:
     converter-display-name     - Name of the converter
     converter-class-impl       - The PluginFactory implementation for
                                  the plugin
     converter-targets          - Can be one or more of these nodes.  Each
                                  contains only a "type" element.  This
                                  "type" element specifies the convert-to
                                  mime-type.
			      
     Each converter node may contain these child nodes:
     converter-description      - Descriptive description of the plug-in.
     converter-vendor           - Plug-in vendor name
     converter-xslt-serialize   - The URL of the xsl stylesheet for
                                  serialization.  This stylesheet must
                                  exist if the xslt plugin implementation
                                  is to be used.  It is assumed that the
                                  plug-in specified via converter-class-impl
                                  will make use of this value.
     converter-xslt-deserialize - The URL of the xsl stylesheet for
                                  deserialization.  This stylesheet must
                                  exist if the xslt plugin implementation
                                  is to be used.  It is assumed that the
                                  plug-in specified via converter-class-impl
                                  will make use of this value.
