/**
 *  <p>A <code>DocumentMerger</code> can merge changes from a modified
 *  &quot;Device&quot; <code>Document</code> to the assigned original
 *  &quot;Office&quot; <code>Document</code>.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Merge is useful when an <code>OfficeDocument</code>
 *  is converted to a &quot;Device&quot; <code>Document</code> format,
 *  and the &quot;Device&quot; <code>Document</code> version is modified.
 *  Those changes can be merged back into the original
 *  <code>OfficeDocument</code> with the merger.  The merger is capable
 *  of doing this even if the &quot;Device&quot; format is lossy in
 *  comparison to the <code>OfficeDocument</code> format.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The <code>ConverterCapabilities</code> object is what the 
 *  DocumentMerger utilizes to know how the &quot;Office&quot;
 *  <code>Document</code> tags are supported in the &quot;Device&quot;
 *  format.</p>
 * 
 *  <p>The <code>DocumentMerger</code> object is created by a
 *  the <code>DocumentMergerFactory</code> {@link
 *  org.openoffice.xmerge.DocumentMergerFactory#createDocumentMerger
 *  createDocumenMerger} method.  When it is constructed, the
 *  &quot;Original Office&quot; <code>Document</code> object is
 *  passed in to be used as input.</p>

     *  <p>Note that this  process may need the knowledge of the
     *  conversion process since some conversion process are lossy.
     *  Items/Data that are lost during the conversion process are not
     *  classified as changes.  The main target of this method

     *  it also will try to preserve items that were originally in
     *  the original <code>Document</code>, but never got transferred
