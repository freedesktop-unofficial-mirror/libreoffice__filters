     *  where the diff will insert (the element count is starting from 0, and 
     *  always insert before the element).  The modPosition is the position 
     *  of the diff in the modified sequence (also starting from 0).</p>
     *
     *  <blockquote><pre>
     *  example:
     *
     *   diff - &lt;B D&gt;and &lt;A B C D E F&gt;
     *   note: &lt;B D&gt;is original sequence and &lt;A B C D E F&gt;
     *   is the modified one.
     *
     *        and here is the position of those sequence:
     *        &lt;B D&gt; &lt;A B C D E F&gt;
     *         0 1   0 1 2 3 4 5
     *
     *   result:
     *   &lt;diff orgPos=0 modPos=0 operation=ADD&gt;  &lt;-- element A
     *   &lt;diff orgPos=1 modPos=2 operation=ADD&gt;  &lt;-- element C
     *   &lt;diff orgPos=2 modPos=4 operation=ADD&gt;  &lt;-- element E
     *   &lt;diff orgPos=2 modPos=5 operation=ADD&gt;  &lt;-- element F
     *
     *  </pre> </blockquote>
     *  <p>One can notice the add operation is inserted before the position. 
     *  Hence, in order to append an element, we will have a position of 
     *  original sequence length + 1 to denote an append.</p>
     *
     *  <p>For DELETE, orgPosition is the position that the element
     *  will be deleted (starting from 0) and modPosition is the position
     *  where the deleted element should be (consider as an ADD).</p>
     *
     *  <p>The modPosition is less useful and it is difficult to understand 
     *  how the position is calculated.  One can just skip this piece of
     *  information.  It is useful if one wants to reverse the role
     *  of original sequence and modified sequence and find out the diff
     *  easily (just change add to delete and delete to add for operation
     *  and swap the orgPosition and modPosition).</p>
