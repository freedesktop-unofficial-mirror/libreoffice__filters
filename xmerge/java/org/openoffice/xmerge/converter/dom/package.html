  <body bgcolor="white">
<p>Provides classes for converting basic document types to/from a  <code>
DOMDocument</code>  object, which can be used by the framework.  </p>
<p>This package provides classes that handle the writing of data to an <code>
 OutputStream</code> object for the {@link org.openoffice.xmerge.DocumentSerializer 
DocumentSerializer} interface for; as well as the reading of data from an 
<code>InputStream</code> object for the framework's {@link org.openoffice.xmerge.DocumentDeserializer 
DocumentDeserializer} interface. Both these framework interfaces are simply 
converters from server-side documents to device specific documents and vice-versa.

<h2>Important Note</h2>
<p>Methods in these classes are not thread safe for performance reasons.
Users of these classes will have to make sure that the usage of these classes
are done in a proper manner.  Possibly more on this later.</p>
