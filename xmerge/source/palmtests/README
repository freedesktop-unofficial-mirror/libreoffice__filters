The following is an outline of the usage of this test suite.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following are required for these qa scripts to run correctly.
	1. POSE: the Palm OS Emulator. This is available from the PalmOS website.
	2. A Palm pilot rom. Also available from Palm.
	3. Compiled xmerge jar files (xmerge.jar, aportisdoc.jar etc.)
	4. Xerces.jar: required by the xmerge framework. This is available from org.apache.com.
 


Test directory Contents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This test environment consists on 3 directories.
	1. bin : This contains some helper scripts that are used by the test environment but can be used in a standalone fashion.
	2. qa : This directory contains the files necessary to run the POSE emulator and to compare this results of tests with a set of verified (golden-data) files.
	3. qa-wrapper: This directory contains some wrapper scripts and environment files, that allow a user to change the environment settings, without have to change the POSE control code itself.
	  
Setting up the environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	The environment can be changes to reflect a particular users environment, by editing or creating an environment file. This files are usually kept in the qa-wrapper/env directory. These environment settings can then be used when running the scripts.

Running the Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Once the environment file has been created, the test scripts can be run by executing the "run-convtest" script in the qa-wrapper/bin directory. This file takes the following arguments

	 run-convtest -env <ENVFILE> [-name RUNNAME]

<ENVFILE> is the environment file to use
optional <RUNNAME> This can be the name of the user running the scripts. This is used to name a directory for the test results to be kept in.

	e.g. run-convtest -env ../env/master.env
