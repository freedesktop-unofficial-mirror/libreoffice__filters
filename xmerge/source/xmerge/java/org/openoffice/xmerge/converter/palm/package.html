<body bgcolor="white">

<p>Provides classes for converting Palm database data to/from a 
<code>PalmDocument</code> object, which can be used by the framework.

<p>This package provides classes that handle the writing of data to
an <code>OutputStream</code> object for the
{@link org.openoffice.xmerge.DocumentSerializer DocumentSerializer}
interface for; as well as the reading of data from an <code>InputStream</code>
object for the framework's
{@link org.openoffice.xmerge.DocumentDeserializer DocumentDeserializer}
interface. Both these framework interfaces are simply converters from
server-side documents to device specific documents and vice-versa.
Since all Palm databases have a general record oriented format, a Palm
database converter specific I/O stream format is specified for the Palm
sync client application to handle the byte stream in a generic way.
This also means that Palm database converters should read and/or write
using this I/O stream format as specified in the next section.</p>

<a name="streamformat">
<h2>Palm database converter specific I/O stream format</h2>
</a>

<p>Note that the format of the byte stream is not exactly that of a PDB
file encoding. It does not need to contain the PDB header information
nor record indices section.  Instead, it contains the following ...</p>

<pre>
    set header
       4 bytes - creator id
       4 bytes - type id
       2 bytes - PDB header version
       2 bytes - PDB header attribute
       unsigned 2 bytes - number of PDB data to follow

    for each PDB,
       32 bytes - name of PDB i
       unsigned 2 bytes - number of records in PDB i

       for each record contained in PDB i,
          1 byte - record attributes
          unsigned 2 bytes - size of record j in PDB i
          x bytes - data
</pre>

<p>Note that each PDB section is appended by another if there is more
than one.</p>

<p>Since the <code>PalmDocument</code> class takes care of the writing
and reading of this format through its <code>write</code> and
<code>read</code> methods, respectively, this format shall also be
referred to as the <b>PalmDocument stream format</b>.</p>

<h2>Usage of the classes for the specified I/O stream</h2>

<p>When converting from a server document to device document(s), the
framework requires writing the device document(s) to an
<code>OutputStream</code> object via the <code>DocumentSerializer</code>
interface. Note that a single server document may be converted
into multiple PDB's on the Palm device. Each worksheet in the document
is converted into a <code>PalmDocument</code> . Thus, if there is more
than one worksheet in the document, more than one <code>PalmDocument</code>
will be produced by the <code>DocumentSerializer</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>DocumentSerializer</code> creates a <code>ConvertData</code> object,
which contains all of the <code>PalmDocuments</code>.  The
{@link org.openoffice.xmerge.converter.palm.PalmDocument#write write}
method to write to the given <code>OutputStream</code>.  The <code>PalmDocument</code>
object will take care of writing the data in the
<a href=#streamformat>specified format</a>.</p>

<p>A <code>DocumentDeserializer</code> can use the <code>PalmDocument</code> object's
{@link org.openoffice.xmerge.converter.palm.PalmDocument#read read}
method to fill in all the <code>PalmDocument</code> object's data.</p>

<h2>PDB file encoding/decoding</h2>

<p>The <code>PalmDocument</code> object's read and write functions are provided
by the <code>PdbDecoder</code> and <code>PdbEncoder</code> objects.  The 
<code>PdbEncoder</code> class provides the functionality of encoding a
<code>PalmDB</code> object into an <code>InputStream</code>, while the
<code>PdbDecoder</code> class provides the functionality of decoding a
PDB file into an <code>OutputStream</code>.</p>

<p>Refer to the class description of each for usage.</p>

<h2>Important Note</h2>

<p>Methods in these classes are not thread safe for performance reasons.
Users of these classes will have to make sure that the usage of these classes
are done in a proper manner.  Possibly more on this later.</p>

<h2>TODO list</h2>

<p><ol>
<li>Merge the PalmDB, PdbDecoder and PdbEncoder classes into the
    PalmDocument class.</li>
<li>After reading more on the palm file format spec, I realized
    that there are certain optional fields that may need to be addressed
    still, like the appInfo block and sortInfo block.</li>
<li>The current PdbDecoder only returns a PalmDB object.  There are other
    information that we may want to expose from the PDB decoding process.</li>
<li>Investigate on different language encoding on the Palm and how that
    affects the PDB name.</li>
</ol></p>
