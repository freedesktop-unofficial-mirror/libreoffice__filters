<p> This package contains the objects that represent BIFF Records for the
pocket excel format. Each one implements the BIFF Record abstract class which
contains three basic functions (read, write and getBiffType). BIFF Records
which are not used do not contain setter's or getter's for their member
variables as some records have a large number of variables. It should be up
to the implementer which attributes get set and which get set to default
values.</p>
