/** @name MzString class

  It was supposed to be used instead of std::string.

  Notes for usage:

  When you declare an MzString, it is initially empty. There is no need to
  do things like #MzString a = "";#, especially not in constructors.

  If you want to use a default empty MzString as a parameter, use

#void foo(MzString par = MzString());	// Correct#

rather than

#void foo(MzString par = "");	// WRONG!#
#void foo(MzString par = 0);	// WRONG!#

(The last one is only wrong because some compilers can't handle it.)

Methods that take an index as parameter all follow this rule: Valid indexes
go from 0 to length()-1.
\begin{tabular}{rl}
Correct: & #foo.substr(0, length()-1);# \\
Wrong:   & #bar.substr(0, length());#
\end{tabular}

It is important that you declare MzStrings as const if possible, because
some methods are much more efficient in const versions.

If you want to check whether a string is empty, do

#if (foo.empty()) something right#

rather than something along the lines of

#if (!foo) completely wrong#

When you use the #.copy()# method, MzString calls "#new []#", so you have to
release the memory with #delete[]#. Don't preallocate memory.

When you want to copy an MzString, just do

#MzString a, b = "String";#
#a = b;	// That's it!#

not something like

#MzString a, b = "String";#
#a = b.copy();#

The class automatically handles deep copying when required.
