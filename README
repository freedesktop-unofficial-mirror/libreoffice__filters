This git repository is part of the "bootstrap" family of Libreoffice repos.
It is obsolete and its only useful content are the LibreOffice 3.3
and 3.4 release branches.

If you are interested in the latest and greatest development branch "master",
or in release branches of LibreOffice versions newer than 3.4, please
check out the "core" git repository, as described on the Wiki:

  http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Native_Build

If you want to build the 3.3 or 3.4 release, you need to switch to the
corresponding release branch:

  ./g checkout libreoffice-3-4

If for some reason you want to look at obsolete in-development code,
check out the "master-backup" branch in this repository; this is most likely
to be a complete waste of time though.
