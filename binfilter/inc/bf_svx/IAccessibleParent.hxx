        about the existence of the new child.  The index of the new child is
        implementation dependent, i.e. it is not garanteed that the
        replacement has the same index as the current child has.

        to let a factory create the new instance with the parameters given, and then
        place the new shape into the own structures.</p>

        @param pCurrentChild
            This child is about to be replaced.

        @param _rxShape
            The UNO shape which the old and new child represent

        @param _nIndex
            The IndexInParent of the old child. Note that the index in
            parent of the replacement is not necessarily the same as
            that of the current child.

        @param _rShapeTreeInfo
            The TreeInfo for the old child.
