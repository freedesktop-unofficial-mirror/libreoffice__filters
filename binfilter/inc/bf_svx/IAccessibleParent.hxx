        replacement has the same index as the current child has.

        to let a factory create the new instance with the parameters given, and then
        place the new shape into the own structures.</p>

        @param pCurrentChild
            This child is about to be replaced.

            The UNO shape which the old and new child represent

            The IndexInParent of the old child. Note that the index in
            parent of the replacement is not necessarily the same as
            that of the current child.
