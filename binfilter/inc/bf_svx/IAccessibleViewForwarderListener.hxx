            the coordinate transformation with a constant visible area.  If
            the visible area changes, just use VISIBLE_AREA.  This changes
            the transformation implicitly.  The value STATE indicates a
            change of the validity state.  Check the IsValid method of the
            view forwarder before doing further calls.
        @param pViewForwarder

            there is more than one view forwarder in use at the same time.
