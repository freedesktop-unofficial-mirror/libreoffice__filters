/** Helper class for objects containing EditEngine text
 
    This class provides the methods from the XAccessibleContext,
    XAccessibleEventBroadcaster and XAccessibleComponent interfaces,
    that are common to all accessible objects containing an edit
    engine. 
  
    You have to implement the SvxEditSource, SvxTextForwarder,
    SvxViewForwarder and SvxEditViewForwarder interfaces in order to
    enable your object to cooperate with this class. SvxTextForwarder
    encapsulates the fact that text objects do not necessarily have an
    EditEngine at their disposal, SvxViewForwarder and
    SvxEditViewForwarder do the same for the document and the edit
    view.
 
    To support changes in edit mode or conversion of fixed text
    into EditEngine text, you can change the SvxEditSource this
    class is referring to. This might render all children invalid
    and change the child count.
 
    This class registers itself at the edit engine as a state
    listener and manages the state of its children (i.e. the
    paragraphs)
 
    @attention All public methods must not be called with any mutex
    hold, except when calling from the main thread (with holds the
    solar mutex), unless stated otherwise. This is because they
    themselves might need the solar mutex in addition to the object
    mutex, and the ordering of the locking must be: first solar mutex,
    then object mutex. Furthermore, state change events might be fired
    internally.
 
    @derive Use this class in an aggregation and forward, or derive
    from it and overwrite. If the Remove/AddEventListener methods are
    overwritten, make sure StateChange is adapted, too.

        The edit source to use. Object ownership is transferred from
        the caller to the callee. The object listens on the
        SvxEditSource for object disposal, so no provisions have to be
        taken if the caller destroys the data (e.g. the model)
        contained in the given SvxEditSource.

        The window of the view this accessibility object is on.
