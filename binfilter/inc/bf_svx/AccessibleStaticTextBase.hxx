    /** Helper class for objects containing EditEngine/Outliner text

        This class implements the XAccessibleText interface for static
        text, somewhat similar to the children of the
        AccessibleTextHelper class. Currently, there are no children,
        i.e. the whole text is presented in one big chunk. This might
        change in the future, if a need for image bullets should
        arise. These, by convention, would be represented as children
        of the text.

        You have to implement the SvxEditSource, SvxTextForwarder,
        SvxViewForwarder and SvxEditViewForwarder interfaces in order
        to enable your object to cooperate with this
        class. SvxTextForwarder encapsulates the fact that text
        objects do not necessarily have an EditEngine at their
        disposal, SvxViewForwarder and SvxEditViewForwarder do the
        same for the document and the edit view. The three mentioned
        forwarder objects are not stored by the AccessibleTextHelper,
        but fetched every time from the SvxEditSource. So you are best
        off making your SvxEditSource::Get*Forwarder methods cache the
        current forwarder.

        As this class is intended for static (i.e. non-changing) text
        only, no event broadcasting is necessary. You must handle
        visibility by yourself, the bounding boxes returned by
        getCharacterBounds() are relative to your accessibility
        object.

        @attention All public non-UNO methods (those are the uppercase
        ones) must not be called with any mutex hold, except when
        calling from the main thread (with holds the solar mutex),
        unless stated otherwise. This is because they themselves might
        need the solar mutex in addition to the object mutex, and the
        ordering of the locking must be: first solar mutex, then
        object mutex. Furthermore, state change events might be fired
        internally.

        @derive Use this class as a base for objects containing static
        edit engine text. To avoid overwriting every interface method
        to intercept derived object defunc state, just set NULL as the
        edit source. Every interface method will then properly throw
        an exception.

            should only be called from the main office thread.

            The EditSource set here is required to broadcast out the

            TEXT_HINT_VIEWSCROLLED. Otherwise, not all state changes
            will get noticed by the accessibility object. Further
            more, when the corresponding core object or the model is
            dying, either the edit source must be set to NULL or it
            has to broadcast a SFX_HINT_DYING hint.

            This class does not have a dispose method, since it is not
            a UNO component. Nevertheless, it holds C++ references to
            several core objects, so you should issue a
            SetEditSource(::std::auto_ptr<SvxEditSource>(NULL)) in
            your dispose() method.
